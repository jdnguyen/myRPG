myRPG
=====

A text base RPG game made by friends for friends. This game was created in 2006 when I first learned how to code. I was in high school then (Junior Year) and I decided to make a game without knowing any data structure. So prepare yourself for hundreds of lines of if statements.
=====

To play this game, add this file to the source and change the target to "myRPG"
It is easiers to play with the Num Keys so make sure your Num Lock is on
and if you didnt see it yet: 8=Up, 5=Down, 4=Left, 6=RIght 
and yes....you have to click enter after everything....
